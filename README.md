# Laravel + AdminLTE
My side project for administrator panel development. Continuing previous project at my [GITLAB](https://gitlab.com/prasetyoadisantoso). This project provides vanilla and no special modification from Laravel and AdminLTE. 

Enjoy and feel free with this source as your project's foundation.
